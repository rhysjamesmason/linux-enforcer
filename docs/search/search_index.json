You can give a limited user on the system access the command \"sudo\" which will give them the powers of root with one command. As explained in the video by Live Overflow it describes the reasons why disabling root access (by SSH) and giving the sudo group. Commands needed to lock the root account For this example I will be using the Ubuntu Server Documentation way of locking the root account on Ubuntu Server. Open up a terminal window by, CTRL + ALT + T Type the following command: sudo passwd -l root What is happening in this command? In this command we are using the sudo key word, which is the way to run root commands as a standed user. The embeded video explains it a lot better. Then we use the keyword of passwd means password, but short. This is how you would change a user(s) accounts password in the terminal. The switch -l means to lock the account of a user in the system. Then finally we have the username of the user you wish to lockout.","title":"Disable the Root Account"},{"location":"Account%20Policy/disable-root/#disable-the-root-account","text":"In some cases you may not want to disable the root account, because it is needed to install most programs on the system.
